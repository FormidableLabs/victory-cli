## Installation

First, install `librsvg`, which is a dependency for this library to work. **THIS IS IMPORTANT**:

If you do not install `librsvg` first, the global install _will blow up_.

#### Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt-get install librsvg2-dev
```

#### RedHat / OpenSUSE:

```bash
sudo yum install librsvg2-devel
```

#### Mac OS X:

```bash
brew install librsvg
```

If, after installing LibRSVG through homebrew you are experiencing issues installing this module,
try manually exporting the package config with this command:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/opt/X11/lib/pkgconfig
```

Then, install this module.

```sh
npm install -g victory-cli
```

For further information, [see this thread](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew/issues/14123).

#### Windows:

You will need cairo and librsvg-2 libraries which is bundled in GTK. Go to http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php
(or http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php for 32-bit node) and download the all-in-one bundle (these instructions
used the following zip http://win32builder.gnome.org/gtk+-bundle_3.6.4-20131201_win64.zip). Unzip the contents
in C:\GTK (if you want to change this you must define `-GTK_Root=c:\another\path` shell variable to npm or node-gyp
to reflect your changes), and add `"C:\GTK\bin;"` to the PATH environment variable in Windows, it's necessary for
node-rsvg runtime to load those libs.

## Usage

Once installed, you can now run `victory-cli` from the command line. Check out the usage info below to
see some of the cool things you can do:

```sh
Usage: victory-cli [data] [script] [options]

  Options:

    -h, --help                   output usage information
    -V, --version                output the version number
    -c, --charttype [charttype]  'area', 'bar', 'line', 'scatter' or 'pie' (default: line)
    -f, --format [format]        'png' or 'svg' (default: png)
    -p, --print                  Prints chart to console (iTerm3 & .png format only!) (default: false)
    -h, --h [h]                  Chart height (default: 500)
    -w, --w [w]                  Chart width (default: 500)
    -x, --x [x]                  Data x value (default: null)
    -y, --y [y]                  Data y value (default: null)
    -t, --theme [theme]          'light', 'dark' or 'hacker' (default: hacker)
```

### Basic Example

So, like [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory/), `victory-cli` comes with some sensible defaults.
To render a default line chart to a png, you would run:

```sh
victory-cli -c line > test.png
```

If you instead wanted an svg file, you could run:

```sh
victory-cli -c line -f svg > test.svg
```

You can also use the `-c` flag to select any of our preset charts, detailed in the usage doc above.

### Images in the Term

Generating images is cool, but displaying charts in the terminal is even cooler! By default `victory-cli` writes
to `stdout`, so you can do things like piping and file output, but you can override this with the `-p` or `--print` flag.

> Note: This only works on iTerm 3. It should work in HyperChart soon.

```sh
victory-cli -c line --print
```

ðŸ’¥ Boom:

### Theming

Out of the box we support a light, dark and hacker (green) theme for your charts. Simply set the `-t` flag
to have the theme applied:

```sh
victory-cli -c area -t light --print
```

### Custom Data

So you brought your own data did ya? Thats cool, its the first argument of this bin. You can pass your
own data in like this:

```sh
victory-cli data/data.json --print
```

We expect the data to be in a regular chart data format like:

```json
{
  "data": [{ "x": 0, "y": 15 }]
}
```

Lets say it isn't though. Thats cool, if its close enough you can use the x and y flags to select your
field names. So if your data looks like this:

```json
{
  "data": [{ "foo": 0, "bar": 15 }]
}
```

It can still work by running:

```sh
victory-cli data/data.json -x foo -y bar --print
```

If your data is too different from what we accept, check out how to do a custom component script below.

### Custom Component Scripts

Ok. You want to get serious here about your customization. We have you covered. The second argument for
this bin is a custom script where you can define the component that gets rendered. All you have to do is
create a file that returns a function that we can pass data and options to, and that returns a React component
that renders a valid SVG.

Check this example out:

```js
// script.js

const React = require("react");
const Victory = require("victory");

const { VictoryChart, VictoryLine, VictoryTheme, VictoryScatter } = Victory;

module.exports = function wrapperComponent(data, options) {
  class VictoryWrapper extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <VictoryChart
          height={options.height}
          width={options.width}
          theme={VictoryTheme.material}
        >
          <VictoryLine
            data={data}
            style={{
              data: {
                stroke: "#3498db",
              },
            }}
          />
          <VictoryScatter
            data={data}
            style={{
              data: {
                fill: "#e74c3c",
              },
            }}
          />
        </VictoryChart>
      );
    }
  }

  return VictoryWrapper;
};
```

After you've created this file, simply run it like this:

```sh
victory-cli data.json script.js --print
```

ðŸ’¥ And it's custom chart city:
